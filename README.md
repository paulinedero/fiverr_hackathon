# fiverr_hackathon

## Goal
Application realized during the second hackathon of the Wild Code School. The goal of the application is to connect professionals registered on Fiverr. In our case, we opted for the creation of a "Team Fiverr" which would allow several people to work on the same project.

## Used technologies
Front : React Native Expo
Back: Express.js / MySql

## Run the app
- To be executed from the Dev-branch
- Git clone.
- NPM install on the mobile application side and server side.
- Connect to MySql and run the script init.sql and then insert.sql.
- /server : use the .env.sample and rename it .env. Use your MySql login information.
- /server : npm run start
- /mobile: expo start or npm run start
- Run on Expo Go (mobile app to download)

## Remarks
The Hackathon lasted 3 days including 48 hours of code. Due to some technical issues, the application is still under development. The Axios API calls still need to be set up / adjusted.
